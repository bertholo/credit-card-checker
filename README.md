# Credit Card Checker

 Functions to check if the credit card is valid using the Luhn algorithm.

 ## The Luhn Formula

 - Drop the last digit from the number. The last digit is what we want to check against
 - Reverse the numbers
 - Multiply the digits in odd positions (1, 3, 5, etc.) by 2 and subtract 9 to all any result higher than 9
 - Add all the numbers together
 - The check digit (the last number of the card) is the amount that you would need to add to get a multiple of 10 (Modulo 10)
